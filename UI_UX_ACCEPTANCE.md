# UI/UX Acceptance Register

**Policy:** [UI_UX_RULES.md](UI_UX_RULES.md) and [SOFTWARE_RULES.md](SOFTWARE_RULES.md) are mandatory for every user-facing screen, panel, modal, widget, context menu, installer, browser toolbar, and interactive console prompt in this repository.

**Status as of 2026-10-12:** **NOT VERIFIED - Under construction ⚠️ for UI acceptance.** This is a documentation and source-inventory checkpoint, NOT a claim that existing applications have been retested or that published stable version labels were changed. No Windows/browser interactive visual run or reference-screenshot comparison has been performed in this audit. Existing stable releases are not silently altered.

Before ANY UI modification, record a control contract for the affected workflows: **control name/ID, unique purpose, click/right-click/hover/keyboard behavior, selection, side effects, persisted data, cancel/error handling, disabled/focus/active states, icon and target geometry**. Eliminate duplicate actions; share design tokens/components.

### Required acceptance process for EACH UI application

1. Run **the actual application**, on its target OS/browser/Picard host, with its real GUI renderer (not mocks).
2. Screenshot each screen and critical state, using at least minimum/default/large viewport and relevant DPI scaling; record image paths and viewport.
3. Compare screenshots to named reference/source UI. Check content hierarchy, alignment, 4px-based spacing, sizing, icon strokes, buttons, image loading, scroll/overlay, accessible labels, and platform expectations.
4. Click/hover/right-click every control; test tab/Enter/Space/Escape, selection/multi-select, focus, resize, scroll, navigation, settings persistence, confirmation/cancel and failure recovery.
5. Include representative end-to-end tasks, empty/large data, missing images/network, interrupted processing, and safe restart. Test any file-changing/destructive action against disposable fixtures.
6. Record **PASS / FAIL / NOT RUN** separately for real rendering, interaction, reference comparison and workflow validation; never equate syntax tests or mocked widgets with a real PASS. Fix all FAIL, complete all NOT RUN before marking UI verified.

| Universal acceptance gate | Status |
| --- | --- |
| UI rules present and required before implementation | PASS - repository-level rule installed |
| Control-by-control inventory and no duplicate actions | NOT RUN |
| Real UI launch with screenshots and reference comparison | NOT RUN |
| Hover, click, keyboard, selection, scroll, resize | NOT RUN |
| Error, cancellation, persistence, restart, recovery | NOT RUN |
| Real host/OS end-to-end workflow and final acceptance | NOT RUN |

## Applications: Frosty Editor and Frosty Mod Manager (WPF/.NET)

**Surfaces:** `FrostyEditor/Windows/*.xaml`, `FrostyModManager/Windows/*.xaml`, shared `FrostyControls/` custom buttons/dialogs/tab controls/image labels, options, asset browsers, mod list/launch panels, progress and error dialogs, splash/login/key prompts. Inspect extension/plugin UI on the screens it contributes to.

**Control contracts/acceptance:** mod list selection and enable/disable, add/remove/import/export, config/settings and save/revert, editor asset selection and property panels, confirmation of destructive actions, progress and error dialogs, custom icon geometry and keyboard focus. Test against actual supported Frostbite installations and current Windows DPI; use safe disposable mod profiles.

**Special caution:** repository documents third-party CC Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives licensing. Inspect licensing before changing upstream UI assets/source; this acceptance register does not authorize unlicensed derivative redistribution.

**Real Windows WPF build/launch/screenshot/interaction:** NOT RUN.

## Next action

Fill the control contract and real-world screenshot/interaction matrix for every UI surface above. Fix all FAIL and NOT RUN before declaring UI verified. Preserve software behavior and target-platform compatibility.
